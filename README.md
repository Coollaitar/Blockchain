| ------ |
| - *Level 1* : Api : It enables two softwares components to communicate with each other using a set of definations or proctols  |
| - *Level 2* : What is Blockhain ? : Permanent Distributed Database shared among multiple nodes on computer network which is impossible to *hack* |
| - Genesis Block : Blockchain start off with a Genesis State |
| - Node : Keeps a copy of global transaction ledger and hence each node can verify and audit transactions happening on the network |
| - Double Spending : Digital Cash scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once |
| - Decentralization : No single authority or middleman , No downtime as the overall network is running across 1000 nodes , Attack Resistant |
| - *Level 3* : What is Web3 ? : Decentralized Internet |
| - Web1 : Read , Web2 : Read-Write , Web3 : Read-Write-Own |
| - What is ETH ? : Ethereum : Decentralized Blockchain |
| - dApps are buit on Ethereum using Solidity Language |
| - Deploy smart contracts on Ethereum Networks |
| -  Ethereum Works on PoW(Proof of Work) but in future it will move on PoS(Proof of Stake) |
| - ETH or Ether : Currency of Ethereum |
| - Smart Contracts : Programmes that are replicated and processes on all the computers on the Ethereum Network |
| - ERC20 Tokens(Smart Contracts) : People can create their own currencies on Ethereum |
| ERC721 and ERC1155 Tokens : Just NFT's and provides requirements to meet when creating NFT's | 
| - Which statement best describes Proof of Work? : Miners compete to solve computational puzzles. The winner of this competition gets to add a block to the blockchain |
| - *Level 4* : Crypto Wallets : Address : Represents your Account address |
| - Private Keys : Just like Password of your Account or Wallet |
| - As your private key is decentralised you don't have an option of forgot password so its important to keep your private key safe and secured |
| - Seed Phrase : Master Password for your Crypto Wallet |
| - Metamask : Ethereum Wallet |
| - *Level 5* : Remix IDE : Used for writing solidity code and testing , debugging and deploying smart contracts |
| - Which of the following environments is NOT supported by Remix? : Solana Testnet |
| - *Level 6* : Solidity : What is Solidity ? : Used to write smart contracts |
| - Runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) |
| - Variables and types : Local / State / Global |
| - Local : Declared inside a function and are not stored on blockchain |
| - State : Declared outside function and stored on blockchain |
| - Global : Provides information about the blockchain : Include things like transaction sender , block timestamp, block hash, etc. |
| - Functions,Loops and If/Else |
| - Arrays, String : Memory Variable and Storage Variable can be compared with Ram V/s Hardisk |
| - Build your first dApp with ether.js |
| - Build your own cryptocurrency using ERC-20 tokens |
